## üéØ **CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY CHECKS**

### ‚ùó **Must Work Perfectly**:
1. **User Registration and Login**: Authentication flow must be seamless
2. **Goal Creation**: Adding goals must work immediately
3. **Time Tracking**: Start/stop timer must accurately track time
4. **Data Persistence**: Goals must survive page refreshes
5. **Date Navigation**: Switching dates must show correct goals
6. **Progress Calculation**: Progress bars must reflect actual logged time

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Potential Issues to Check**:
1. **Timer Precision**: Verify timer stops exactly when clicked (not delayed)
